Hey! I'm a BS/MS student @ Rochester Institute of Technology, graduating in 2024.
I started out self-taught with a Python discord bot [Porygon2](https://github.com/chafla/Pory2), before taking other courses and eventually going to RIT for CS.

This account is still primarily my public face for most work, but lately I've been focusing on contributing to an open-source game, Space Station 13. 
Most of my contributions there can be found at https://github.com/lewcc.
